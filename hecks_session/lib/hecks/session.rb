module Hecks
  # Hecks::Session
  #
  # Interactive domain-building session for REPL-driven development. Supports
  # two modes: "sketch" (define aggregates, commands, policies) and "play"
  # (execute commands and inspect events against a live compiled domain).
  #
  # A Session holds a collection of AggregateBuilder instances keyed by name,
  # each wrapped in an AggregateHandle for interactive use. The session can
  # validate the domain, compile it into a gem, switch into play mode for
  # live execution, and serialize back to DSL source.
  #
  # Includes:
  # - BuildActions  -- validate, preview, build, save, to_dsl
  # - PlayMode      -- play!, sketch!, events, history, reset!
  # - Presenter     -- describe, status, inspect
  # - SystemBrowser -- browse (tree view of domain elements)
  #
  #   session = Hecks.session("Pizzas")
  #   session.aggregate("Pizza") { attribute :name, String }
  #   session.validate
  #   session.build
  #   session.play!
