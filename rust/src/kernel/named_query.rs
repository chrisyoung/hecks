// HAND-WRITTEN, ONCE, GENERIC — the same "compile shapes, interpret
// behavior" split this kernel already holds every OTHER reaction/mutation
// table to (`PolicyRule`/orchestrate.rs, `ProcessManagerDef`/orchestrate.rs):
// a declared bluebook `query "Name" do ... end` block compiles down to a
// static `QueryDef` row (`rust/project/queries.rb`'s own `query_conditions`,
// `rust/project/registry.rb`'s own `emit_query_table`), and `run` below is
// the ONE hand-written interpreter every generated domain's own `QUERIES`
// table is walked through — never bespoke per-query Rust control flow.
//
// SCOPE: exactly the subset `rust/project/queries.rb`'s own
// `query_skip_reason` admits — one or more field-comparator conditions,
// ANDed together, against a single aggregate's OWN attributes, PLUS (as of
// 2026-08-11) a declared `order_by`/`limit` on that same result set, PLUS
// (as of Phase 10, equivalence-gap plan) a declared `offset` on it too —
// still no cursor/consistency/freshness/authorization/null_semantics/
// inspection/index_hints; no where clause hopping through a
// reference; no literal comparator value whose true JSON type the
// exported IR can't recover; no order_by field that doesn't reduce to a
// plain JSON string or number. A declared query outside that subset
// simply has no row in the generated table at all — `kernel/cli.rs`'s own
// STRING-shaped "query" step refuses it the same clean way an unrouted
// command already does, never silently wrong.
//
// GROUND TRUTH: `Runtime::QueryInterpreter#interpret`
// (lib/hecks/runtime/query_interpreter.rb), read directly — for THIS
// subset specifically (no hop), `interpret` and its own differential twin
// `reference_interpret` are PROVABLY the identical answer, order_by/
// offset/limit included: both share the exact same `ordered`/`skipped`/
// `capped` sequence — `ordered = ordered(matched, declared.order_by,
// declared.null_semantics)`, then `skipped = declared.offset ? ordered.
// drop(resolve_query_value(declared.offset.value, args).to_i) : ordered`
// (OFFSET FIRST — SQL's own `LIMIT n OFFSET m` order, not the reverse),
// then `capped = declared.limit ? skipped.first(resolve_query_value(
// declared.limit.value, args).to_i) : skipped` — applied AFTER the where
// clauses (`matched`), which is the only place the two interpreters ever
// differ (`reference_where_holds?` vs plain `where_holds?`); a hop-free
// where clause makes `reference_where_holds?` fall straight through to
// `where_holds?` via its own early return (`return where_holds?(clause,
// record, args) unless step`), so order_by/offset/limit run on an
// IDENTICAL `matched` set either way, never a second, separately-computed
// answer.
// `kernel/cli.rs`'s STRING-form dispatch leans on exactly this property
// to report `reference_rows` as a clone of `rows` rather than actually
// re-running a second walk.
//
// order_by/limit ARE NOT hand-written here a second time — `query_ordering
// ::apply` (kernel/query_ordering.rs) is the SAME identity-sort/declared-
// order/limit tail `read_model::run` already calls for a read model's own
// eligible head; that module's own header has the full argument for why a
// declared query needing this was simple reuse rather than new invention
// once it existed, and the one real structural difference between the two
// callers (a read model choosing among several aggregate heads; a query
// ordering/capping its own single result set directly, with no head
// selection at all).
