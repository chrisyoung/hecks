// HAND-WRITTEN, ONCE, GENERIC — a direct structural port of
// `Hecksagain::Bluebook::Expression::Evaluator` and `::Resolver`
// (docs/guides/running-a-runtime.md's "The expression grammar"), not a
// reimplementation of parsing. bin/project_rust parses real canonical
// `given`/`ensures`/invariant text with the REAL Ruby parser and emits
// `Expr` DATA literals from that AST; the only thing written here is
// INTERPRETATION — `Evaluator#interpret`/`Resolver#interpret`, ported.
//
// This is what replaces compiling each expression to bespoke Rust
// boolean source: one generic `interpret()` walks ANY expression this
// grammar can produce, driven by data a generator emits, the same way
// `CommandInterpreter` is one Ruby method that walks any command's IR
// rather than one method per command shape.
//
// THIS FILE IS A ROUTER, NOT WHERE THE LOGIC LIVES. Every real
// interpretation rule — what `+` does, what `.empty?` does on a list vs
// a string, what a `:composite` field's dotted lookup does — is in
// `expression_operators/<category>.rs` or `attribute_shapes/<shape>.rs`,
// one file per capability, named after the exact vocabulary
// `bin/ir --meta` (attribute shapes) and `lib/hecksagain/bluebook/
// expression/projection.json` (operator categories) already use for it.
// `interpret`'s own match handles ONLY the leaves no capability file
// owns (literals, `Lookup`) plus `dispatch_operator`, below, which is
// EXHAUSTIVE OVER THE GENERATED `OperatorCategory` ENUM WITH NO
// WILDCARD ARM ON PURPOSE: `bin/project_kernel_capabilities` regenerates
// that enum straight from the live Ruby grammar (`OperatorCategory`'s
// own header names the exact call), so the day a `given`/`ensures`/
// invariant clause gains a new kind of operator, this match stops
// compiling until a real arm — and the file it calls into — exists for
// it. A `_ =>` arm here would silently swallow that day instead,
// routing the new category into whatever arm happened to sit above it,
// compiling cleanly while quietly interpreting the new capability WRONG.
// That failure mode is the entire reason this refactor exists, so this
// match must never grow one back.
//
// PRD 11 — `Expr` ITSELF MOVED OUT OF THIS FILE, to `../mod.rs`,
// GENERATED from `Hecksagain::Bluebook::Expression::NodeShapeRust`. This
// file kept everything else unchanged — the split is structural
// (one file becomes two), not behavioural.

// never index into its elements by expression — so a list field
// surfaces as its length, not its contents. Each variant IS one of the

// `Float`/`Str`/`Bool` are `:scalar`, `List` is `:list`, `Nil` is
