// HAND-WRITTEN, ONCE, GENERIC — the same "compile shapes, interpret

// `read_model` construct; `report` is the language's own word for it, per
// `language/bluebook/syntax.bluebook`'s `was: "read_model"`) compiles down
// to a static `ReadModelDef` row (`rust/project/read_models.rb`'s own
// `read_model_def`/`emit_read_model_table`), and `run` below is the ONE
// hand-written interpreter every generated domain's own `READ_MODELS`
// table is walked through — never bespoke per-read-model Rust control flow.
//
// SCOPE: exactly the subset `rust/project/read_models.rb`'s own
// `read_model_skip_reason` admits — a ROOT aggregate fetched by its own
// reference id, plus one or more OTHER aggregate heads found by scanning
// and matching a reference attribute back to an already-projected

// `limit` on the ONE eligible many-side head (`filtered_head`, below), PLUS
// (as of Phase 10, equivalence-gap plan) that same head's own `offset` too —
// `IR::ReadModel#to_h` now spells these four on the wire (`read_models.rb`'s
// own header has the history: it didn't used to). Still no `cursor`/
// `consistency`/`authorize`(TenantScope)/`nulls` beyond the

// query, applied consistently here (`read_models.rb`'s own header has the
// full argument). A declared read model outside that subset simply has no
// row in the generated table at all — `kernel/cli.rs`'s own STRING-shaped
// "query" step refuses it the same clean way an unrouted verb or an
