        # an optional field a record predates (measured, not assumed: a

        # entity's pre-mutation `view` does, same as an aggregate's
        # `Instance`); a `subject` with no `.aggregate` just hydrates

        # MERGE ORDER MATTERS, and it is NOT "args always win": an
        # unaliased command-level reference dereferences under a
        # different name than the argument holds (`account_id` the arg,
        # `account` the hydrated key — no collision, order is moot). An
        # ALIASED one (`reference_to Customer, as: :customer`) hydrates
        # under the SAME name the argument itself holds — `customer` is
        # both the raw id an arg puts there and the key `customer.status`
        # expects to dig into. If `args` merged last, the raw id (a
        # String) would win and `.status` on a String is where a fuzzer
        # found this — TypeError, not a refusal. Command-level
        # dereferencing is the one thing that is SUPPOSED to override
        # its own source argument for exactly this reason; args still
        # wins over stored OWNER state (unchanged from before this fix).
        # `parent:` is an entity command's OWN parent aggregate record
        # (EntityInterpreter's `ctx.instance` — "the PARENT aggregate
        # record", its own doc comment) — the entity's containment, not a
        # declared reference attribute, so it doesn't come from
        # `dereference`'s attribute scan the way `owner`'s do. Hydrated
        # the same shape regardless: the parent's own state, plus ITS OWN
        # references dereferenced one level in, so `parent.customer.status`
        # (a parent aggregate reaching ITS OWN customer) resolves the same
        # way `account.customer.status` does for a command-level reference.
