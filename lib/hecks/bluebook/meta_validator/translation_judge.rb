      # A sibling of a bluebook again, the same shape PortJudge/

      # rather than left as plain Ruby structs nothing checks. Walks the
      # WHOLE built translation in one pass — the top-level Declare/
      # Retire commands, then every nested aggregate's own Declare plus
      # one Add* command per rule it carries — the same "one judge, every
      # nested record" shape WorldJudge already gives Wiring. Field names
      # throughout read lib/hecks/bluebook/translation.rb's own real
      # struct/class definitions directly, not the DSL builder's own
      # local parameter names (`move(old_path, to:)`'s `old_path` reads
      # back as the struct's own `from`). Whole-project table-
      # unification survey, item #13's remaining builders.
