# Hecks::DomainModel::Behavior
#
# Namespace for domain behavior representations: commands (intent to change
# state), events (records of what happened), policies (reactive rules and
# guards), queries (named lookups), specifications (reusable predicates),
# workflows (multi-step orchestrations), services (cross-aggregate orchestration),
# read models (event-driven projections), and event subscribers (arbitrary
# event handlers).
#
# Part of the DomainModel IR layer. Each child class is a plain data object
# (intermediate representation) built by the DSL builders and consumed by
# generators to produce runtime domain code.
#
# == Child classes
#
#   Behavior::Command         # intent to change aggregate state
#   Behavior::Condition       # pre/postcondition assertion on a command
#   Behavior::DomainEvent     # record that something happened
#   Behavior::EventSubscriber # arbitrary code block fired on an event
#   Behavior::Policy          # reactive rule (event->command) or guard block
#   Behavior::Query           # named, reusable lookup
#   Behavior::ReadModel       # event-driven denormalized projection
#   Behavior::Service         # cross-aggregate orchestration
#   Behavior::Specification   # named, reusable boolean predicate
#   Behavior::Workflow        # conditional multi-step command orchestration
