# Hecks::ValidationRules::Naming
#
# Naming convention rules for domain validation. This module groups rules that
# enforce proper naming throughout the domain model:
#
# - +CommandNaming+ -- commands must start with a verb (uses WordNet + custom verbs)
# - +NameCollisions+ -- aggregate root names must not collide with value object/entity names
# - +UniqueAggregateNames+ -- no duplicate aggregate names within a domain
# - +ReservedNames+ -- rejects Ruby keywords as attribute names and invalid aggregate constants
#
# All rules are autoloaded and executed as part of +Hecks.validate+.
#
