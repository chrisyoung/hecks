    # Validates that all +reference_to+ attributes target existing aggregate roots.
    # Catches three kinds of mistakes:
    # 1. Referencing a value object instead of an aggregate root
    # 2. Referencing an entity instead of an aggregate root
    # 3. Referencing a name that does not exist in the domain at all
    #
    # Each error includes an actionable hint (promote to aggregate, reference
    # the owning aggregate, or lists available aggregates).
