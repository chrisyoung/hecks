    # Hecks::ValidationRules::References
    #
    # Reference integrity rules for domain validation. This module groups rules
    # that enforce correct usage of aggregate references:
    #
    # - +ValidReferences+ -- references must target existing aggregate roots (not value objects or entities)
    # - +NoBidirectionalReferences+ -- no mutual A->B and B->A references between aggregates
    # - +NoSelfReferences+ -- aggregates cannot reference themselves
    #
    # All rules are autoloaded and executed as part of +Hecks.validate+.
    #
