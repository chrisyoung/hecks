# Hecksagon DSL Reference

> Generated from Hecks v2026.03.31.13

Complete reference for the hexagonal architecture wiring DSL. The Hecksagon declares infrastructure concerns — gates, adapters, extensions, cross-domain subscriptions, and tenancy — separately from the domain model defined in the Bluebook.

## Overview

The Hecksagon is the hexagonal architecture layer. While the Bluebook defines *what* your domain is (aggregates, commands, events, policies), the Hecksagon defines *how* it connects to the outside world (who can access what, where data is stored, which extensions are active).

```ruby
Hecks.hecksagon "Pizzas" do
  adapter :sqlite, database: "pizzas.db"

  gate "Pizza", :admin do
    allow :find, :all, :create_pizza, :add_topping
  end

  gate "Pizza", :guest do
    allow :find, :all
  end

  extension :audit
  subscribe "Billing"
  tenancy :row
end
```

---

## Gate

A gate is role-based access control for an aggregate. It declares which operations a specific role is allowed to perform. When a gate is active, any attempt to call a disallowed method raises an error.

Gates replace ports from the Bluebook DSL. The difference: ports were mixed into the domain definition, but access control is an infrastructure concern — it depends on deployment context, not domain logic. The same domain might have different gates in a public API vs. an admin panel.

```ruby
gate "Pizza", :admin do
  allow :find, :all, :create_pizza, :add_topping, :delete
end

gate "Pizza", :guest do
  allow :find, :all
end

gate "Order", :customer do
  allow :find, :all, :place_order
end
```

The first argument is the aggregate name, the second is the role. The `allow` method takes any number of method symbols.

Standard methods you can gate:
- **Read**: `:find`, `:all`, `:count`, `:first`, `:last`, `:where`
- **Write**: `:create`, `:save`, `:update`, `:destroy`, `:delete`
- **Commands**: any command method name (e.g., `:create_pizza`, `:place_order`)

## Adapter

Declares the persistence adapter for the domain. This is where you choose between in-memory storage, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a custom adapter.

```ruby
# In-memory (default, no declaration needed)
adapter :memory

# SQLite
adapter :sqlite, database: "pizzas.db"

# PostgreSQL
adapter :postgres, host: "localhost", database: "pizzas", user: "app"

# MySQL
adapter :mysql2, host: "localhost", database: "pizzas"
```

Without an adapter declaration, Hecks defaults to `:memory`.

---

## Extension

Extensions add cross-cutting capabilities to the runtime — audit logging, rate limiting, authentication, idempotency, etc. They hook into the boot sequence and wire behavior across all aggregates.

```ruby
extension :audit
extension :rate_limit, max: 100
extension :idempotency
```

Extensions are registered globally and fired during `Hecks.boot`. The Hecksagon declares which extensions are active for this domain.

---

## Subscribe

Declares that this domain listens to events from another domain. Used in multi-domain setups where domains communicate via a shared event bus.

```ruby
subscribe "Billing"
subscribe "Shipping"
```

This enables cross-domain reactive policies: when the Billing domain publishes an event, this domain can react to it.

---

## Tenancy

Sets the multi-tenancy isolation strategy for the domain. Determines how the runtime separates data between tenants.

```ruby
tenancy :row       # row-level isolation (tenant_id column)
tenancy :schema    # schema-level isolation (separate schemas per tenant)
```

---

## Booting with a Hecksagon

When you call `Hecks.boot`, it looks for both a Bluebook (domain definition) and a Hecksagon (infrastructure wiring) in the project directory. If no Hecksagon is found, defaults are used (memory adapter, no gates, no extensions).

```ruby
# Define domain
Hecks.domain "Pizzas" do
  aggregate "Pizza" do
    attribute :name, String
    command "CreatePizza" do
      attribute :name, String
    end
  end
end

# Define infrastructure
Hecks.hecksagon "Pizzas" do
  adapter :sqlite, database: "pizzas.db"
  gate "Pizza", :admin do
    allow :find, :all, :create_pizza
  end
end

# Boot with a specific gate active
app = Hecks.load(domain, port: :admin)
```
