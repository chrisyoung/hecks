# Hecks DSL Reference

> Generated from Hecks v2026.03.31.13

Complete reference for the Bluebook domain definition language.

## Domain

A domain is a bounded context — a self-contained area of your business with its own language, rules, and data. In DDD, you split a system into domains to keep each part focused and decoupled. A pizza shop has a "Pizzas" domain; a bank has "Accounts", "Loans", and "Transfers" domains. Each domain compiles independently into its own gem, runtime, and persistence layer.

Everything in Hecks lives inside a `Hecks.domain` block:

```ruby
Hecks.domain "Pizzas" do
  aggregate "Pizza" do
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Domain-level methods

At the domain level you can declare aggregates, cross-aggregate policies, services, read models, workflows, actors, tenancy, and glossary rules:

```ruby
Hecks.domain "Banking" do
  aggregate "Account" do ... end

  # Cross-aggregate reactive policies
  policy "DisburseFunds" do
    on "IssuedLoan"
    trigger "Deposit"
    map principal: :amount
  end

  # Domain services (coordinate multiple aggregates)
  service "TransferMoney" do
    attribute :source_id, String
    attribute :dest_id, String
    attribute :amount, Float
    coordinates "Account", "Ledger"
    call do
      dispatch("Withdraw", account_id: source_id, amount: amount)
      dispatch("Deposit", account_id: dest_id, amount: amount)
    end
  end

  # Read model projections
  view "OrderSummary" do
    project("PlacedOrder") { |event, state| state.merge(total: event.quantity) }
  end

  # Workflows with branching
  workflow "LoanApproval" do
    step "ScoreLoan", score: :principal
    branch do
      when_spec("HighRisk") { step "ReviewLoan" }
      otherwise { step "ApproveLoan" }
    end
  end

  # Scheduled workflows
  workflow "OverdueCheck" do
    schedule "daily"
    step "ProcessOverdue" do
      find "Loan", spec: :overdue
      trigger "MarkDelinquent"
    end
  end

  # Actors
  actor "Customer"
  actor "Admin", description: "System administrator"

  # Multi-tenancy
  tenancy :row

  # Ubiquitous language enforcement
  glossary do
    prefer "stakeholder", not: ["user", "person"]
  end

  # Logical grouping
  domain_module "PolicyManagement" do
    aggregate "GovernancePolicy" do ... end
  end

  # Domain-level event subscriber
  on_event "CreatedPizza" do |event|
    puts event.name
  end
end
```

### Implicit syntax

PascalCase names with blocks become aggregates:

```ruby
Hecks.domain "Pizzas" do
  Pizza do
    attribute :name, String
    command "CreatePizza" do
      attribute :name, String
    end
  end
end
```

## Aggregate

An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes. It has a root entity (the aggregate itself), owns its value objects and entities, and enforces its own invariants. Every write goes through a command on the aggregate — you never modify child objects directly.

Aggregates are the consistency boundary: everything inside one is guaranteed to be consistent after each command. References between aggregates are loose — they point to each other by identity, not by containment.

```ruby
aggregate "Pizza" do
  # Attributes
  attribute :name, String
  attribute :description, String
  attribute :price, Float
  attribute :active, :boolean
  attribute :metadata, Hash
  attribute :toppings, list_of("Topping")
  attribute :status, String, default: "draft"
  attribute :category, String, enum: ["classic", "specialty", "seasonal"]
  attribute :email, String, pii: true

  # References (relationships to other aggregates)
  reference_to "Restaurant"
  reference_to "Team", role: "home_team"      # explicit role
  reference_to "Billing::Invoice"             # cross-domain

  # Value objects (immutable, no identity)
  value_object "Topping" do
    attribute :name, String
    attribute :amount, Integer
    invariant "amount must be positive" do
      amount > 0
    end
  end

  # Entities (mutable, with identity)
  entity "LedgerEntry" do
    attribute :amount, Float
    attribute :description, String
  end

  # Commands
  command "CreatePizza" do
    attribute :name, String
    attribute :description, String
  end

  # Validations
  validation :name, presence: true
  validation :email, presence: true, type: String, uniqueness: true

  # Invariants
  invariant "price must be positive" do
    price > 0
  end

  # Lifecycle (state machine)
  attribute :status, String, default: "draft" do
    transition "PublishPizza" => "published", from: "draft"
    transition "ArchivePizza" => "archived", from: ["draft", "published"]
  end

  # Queries
  query "ByDescription" do |desc|
    where(description: desc)
  end

  # Scopes
  scope :active, status: "active"
  scope :by_style, ->(style) { { style: style } }

  # Indexes
  index :email, unique: true
  index :name, :status

  # Specifications (reusable predicates)
  specification "HighValue" do |pizza|
    pizza.price > 20
  end

  # Policies (reactive: event -> trigger)
  policy "NotifyKitchen" do
    on "CreatedPizza"
    trigger "PrepareIngredients"
    async true
    condition { |event| event.name != "Test" }
  end

  # Ports (access control per role)
  port :admin do
    allow :find, :all, :create_pizza, :archive_pizza
  end
  port :guest, [:find, :all]

  # Event subscribers
  on_event "CreatedPizza", async: true do |event|
    puts "Pizza created: #{event.name}"
  end

  # Repository interface
  repository :find, :all, :save, :delete

  # Factories
  factory "BuildFromCart" do
    attribute :cart_id, String
  end

  # Explicit events (not inferred from commands)
  event "PizzaExpired" do
    attribute :reason, String
  end

  # Versioning and attachments
  versioned
  attachable
end
```

### Implicit syntax

Inside an aggregate block, you can use shorthand — bare names with types become attributes, PascalCase with blocks become value objects, and snake_case with blocks become commands:

```ruby
aggregate "Pizza" do
  name String                    # attribute :name, String
  price Float                    # attribute :price, Float

  Topping do                     # value_object "Topping" do
    name String
    amount Integer
  end

  create do                      # command "CreatePizza" do
    name String
    price Float
  end
end
```

---

## Command

A command is an intent to change state — "create this pizza", "place this order", "cancel this subscription". Commands are the only way to modify aggregates. Each command automatically infers a domain event by converting the verb to past tense (CreatePizza -> CreatedPizza).

A command that includes a self-referencing `reference_to` (pointing to its own aggregate) is an **update** command — the runtime finds the existing aggregate by ID and applies the changes. A command without a self-reference is a **create** command — the runtime constructs a new aggregate.

```ruby
command "PlaceOrder" do
  # Input attributes
  attribute :customer_name, String
  attribute :quantity, Integer

  # References to other aggregates
  reference_to "Pizza"
  reference_to "Restaurant", role: "pickup_location"

  # Guard policy (must pass before execution)
  guarded_by "MustBeAuthenticated"

  # Static field assignments
  sets status: "pending", ordered_at: :now

  # Actors who can issue this command
  actor "Customer"
  actor "Admin"

  # Documentation: what data this command needs
  read_model "Menu & Availability"

  # External system dependencies
  external "PaymentGateway"

  # Pre/postconditions
  precondition "quantity must be positive" do |agg|
    quantity > 0
  end

  postcondition "order count increased" do |before, after|
    after.count > before.count
  end

  # Custom handler (overrides default create/update)
  handler do |cmd, agg|
    # complex domain logic
  end

  # Or inline call body
  call do
    # lightweight logic
  end
end
```

### Event inference

The command verb is automatically converted to past tense:

| Command | Inferred Event |
|---------|---------------|
| CreatePizza | CreatedPizza |
| PlaceOrder | PlacedOrder |
| SubmitApplication | SubmittedApplication |
| SendInvoice | SentInvoice |
| DenyRequest | DeniedRequest |

### Implicit syntax

Inside a command block:

```ruby
command "CreatePizza" do
  name String        # attribute :name, String
  price Float        # attribute :price, Float
end
```

---

## Reference

In DDD, aggregates don't contain each other — they reference each other. A reference says "this Order knows about a Pizza" without the Order owning the Pizza. The domain layer works with live objects, never with foreign key IDs. The persistence layer handles the ID conversion transparently.

Use `reference_to` when one aggregate needs to know about another. If you need multiple references to the same type (e.g., home_team and away_team both pointing to Team), use the `role:` option.

```ruby
aggregate "Order" do
  # Role defaults to downcased type name (:pizza)
  reference_to "Pizza"

  # Explicit role (required when multiple refs to same type)
  reference_to "Team", role: "home_team"
  reference_to "Team", role: "away_team"

  # Cross-domain reference
  reference_to "Billing::Invoice"

  # References in commands
  command "PlaceOrder" do
    reference_to "Pizza"
    attribute :quantity, Integer
  end
end
```

Reference kinds (inferred automatically after build):

| Kind | When |
|------|------|
| `:composition` | Target is a value object or entity within the same aggregate |
| `:aggregation` | Target is another aggregate root |
| `:cross_context` | Target is in a different bounded context (qualified with `::`) |

---

## Types

Hecks supports Ruby's built-in types plus collection and custom type references. Attributes are the data fields on aggregates, value objects, entities, commands, and events.

### Built-in types

| Type | Aliases |
|------|---------|
| `String` | `:string`, `:str` |
| `Integer` | `:integer`, `:int` |
| `Float` | `:float` |
| `TrueClass` (Boolean) | `:boolean`, `:bool` |
| `Symbol` | `:symbol`, `:sym` |
| `Array` | `:array` |
| `Hash` | `:hash` |
| `Date` | `:date` |
| `DateTime` | `:datetime` |
| `JSON` | (use directly) |

### Collection types

```ruby
attribute :toppings, list_of("Topping")
attribute :tags, list_of(String)
```

### Custom types

PascalCase strings reference value objects, entities, or other domain types:

```ruby
attribute :address, "Address"     # references a value object
attribute :status, "OrderStatus"  # references a custom type
```

### Attribute options

```ruby
attribute :name, String                          # required, no default
attribute :status, String, default: "draft"      # with default
attribute :role, String, enum: ["admin", "user"] # constrained values
attribute :email, String, pii: true              # PII flag
```

### Identity (natural key)

Aggregates always have a UUID as their canonical ID. You can additionally declare a natural key composed from attributes for human-meaningful lookups and deduplication. PII attributes cannot be part of the identity.

```ruby
aggregate "TeamCycle" do
  attribute :team, String
  attribute :start_date, Date

  identity :team, :start_date
end

# TeamCycle.find(uuid)                                    # always works
# TeamCycle.find_by_identity(team: "Alpha", start_date: Date.today)  # natural key
```

---

## Lifecycle

A lifecycle is a state machine on a single attribute. It declares which commands trigger which state transitions, and optionally constrains which source states are valid. The runtime enforces these transitions — if you try to publish a post that's already archived, it raises an error.

Declare as a block on the attribute itself (the `default:` becomes the initial state):

```ruby
attribute :status, String, default: "draft" do
  transition "SubmitForReview" => "pending"
  transition "ApprovePost" => "published", from: "pending"
  transition "RejectPost" => "rejected", from: "pending"
  transition "ArchivePost" => "archived", from: ["published", "rejected"]
end
```

Or as a separate declaration:

```ruby
lifecycle :status, default: "draft" do
  transition "SubmitForReview" => "pending"
  transition "ApprovePost" => "published", from: "pending"
end
```

The `from:` constraint is optional. Without it, the transition is allowed from any state. With it, the runtime raises an error if the current state doesn't match.

State predicates are generated automatically:

```ruby
post.draft?      # => true
post.published?  # => false
```

---

## Policy

Policies are the domain's reaction system. A reactive policy listens for a domain event and automatically triggers another command — "when an order is placed, create an invoice." This is how you coordinate between aggregates without coupling them directly.

Guard policies are pre-checks that run before a command executes — "only admins can delete posts."

### Reactive policy

```ruby
# On an aggregate
policy "NotifyChef" do
  on "PlacedOrder"
  trigger "PrepareIngredients"
  async true
  map pizza: :pizza, quantity: :servings
  defaults priority: "normal"
  condition { |event| event.quantity > 5 }
end

# Cross-aggregate (domain level)
policy "CreateInvoice" do
  on "PlacedOrder"
  trigger "GenerateInvoice"
  map order: :reference
end
```

### Guard policy

```ruby
policy "MustBeAdmin" do |cmd|
  cmd.role == "admin"
end
```

Referenced from commands with `guarded_by "MustBeAdmin"`.

---

## Validation and Invariants

Validations are field-level checks (is this field present? is it the right type? is it unique?). Invariants are aggregate-level business rules that must always hold true — they're checked after every state change.

The difference: validations check individual fields in isolation, invariants check relationships between fields or complex business logic.

### Validations (field-level)

```ruby
validation :name, presence: true
validation :email, presence: true, type: String, uniqueness: true
```

### Invariants (aggregate-level business rules)

```ruby
invariant "price must be positive" do
  price > 0
end

invariant "end date after start date" do
  end_date > start_date
end
```

Value objects and entities also support invariants:

```ruby
value_object "Money" do
  attribute :amount, Float
  attribute :currency, String
  invariant "amount must be non-negative" do
    amount >= 0
  end
end
```

---

## Access Control (Gates)

Access control is an infrastructure concern, not a domain concept. Gates (formerly "ports") are declared in the [Hecksagon](hecksagon_reference.md), not the Bluebook. See the Hecksagon DSL Reference for gate syntax.

---

## Query and Scope

Queries and scopes give you named, reusable ways to find aggregates. Queries are custom logic blocks that can accept parameters. Scopes are simpler — either static condition hashes or parameterized lambdas.

Both are wired as class methods on the aggregate at runtime: `Pizza.by_description("Classic")` or `Pizza.classics_scope`.

### Queries (custom logic)

```ruby
query "ByDescription" do |desc|
  where(description: desc)
end

query "Classics" do
  where(style: "Classic").order(:name)
end
```

### Scopes (named filters)

```ruby
# Hash scope (static conditions)
scope :active, status: "active"
scope :premium, tier: "premium"

# Lambda scope (parameterized)
scope :by_price, ->(min) { { price: Hecks::Querying::Operators::Gte.new(min) } }
```

### Indexes

Indexes declare which fields should be indexed in the database for query performance:

```ruby
index :email, unique: true
index :name, :status           # composite index
```

---

## Specification

A specification is a named boolean predicate — "is this loan high risk?", "is this invoice overdue?" Specifications are reusable: you can use them to filter collections, branch in workflows, or validate conditions.

They're the DDD way to extract complex conditional logic into a named, testable object.

```ruby
specification "HighRisk" do |loan|
  loan.principal > 50_000
end

specification "Overdue" do |invoice|
  invoice.due_date < Date.today && invoice.status == "unpaid"
end
```

Used in workflows:

```ruby
workflow "LoanApproval" do
  branch do
    when_spec("HighRisk") { step "ManualReview" }
    otherwise { step "AutoApprove" }
  end
end
```

---

## Booting

Hecks compiles your domain definition into a running application. `boot` loads the domain from a directory, validates it, generates Ruby classes, and wires everything together. `load` does the same from an in-memory domain object.

### Standalone app

```ruby
# Boot from a directory containing hecks_domain.rb
app = Hecks.boot(__dir__)

# With SQL persistence
app = Hecks.boot(__dir__, adapter: :sqlite)
```

### Rails

```ruby
# config/initializers/hecks.rb
Hecks.configure do |config|
  config.domain_path = Rails.root.join("app/domain")
  config.adapter = :memory
end
```

### Running commands

Commands become class methods on the aggregate. References accept either a live object or a raw ID string at the boundary:

```ruby
pizza = Pizza.create(name: "Margherita", description: "Classic")
order = Order.place(pizza: pizza, customer_name: "Alice", quantity: 3)

# Or with a raw ID at the boundary:
Order.place(pizza: "some-uuid", quantity: 3)

Pizza.find(pizza.id)
Pizza.all
Pizza.count
Pizza.by_description("Classic")
```

### Events

```ruby
app.on("CreatedPizza") do |event|
  puts "#{event.name} created at #{event.occurred_at}"
end

app.events  # => array of all published events
```
