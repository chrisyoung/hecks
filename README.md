# hecks

hecks is an **executable domain specification language**. A `.bluebook`
file declares a business domain — aggregates, value objects, commands,
invariants, policies, queries — and that declaration *is* the running
system. There is no handler code, no separate implementation to keep in
sync: `given` guards a command, `sets` mutates state, `emits` announces
an event, and the runtime dispatches all of it directly from the
declaration. A domain is data, so it can be read, diffed, versioned, and
compiled into another language the same way any other data can.

The language surface is small: [22 contexts](docs/implemented/reference/index.md),
every one of them documented with a runnable example. Most of what's
below fits on one screen. [Getting started](docs/implemented/guides/getting-started.md)
is a five-minute read from zero to a booted domain.

Ruby is the reference implementation. A generated Rust runtime reads the
same canonical IR and runs the same domain, checked against Ruby
continuously — see [Runtimes](#runtimes).

## Quickstart

```sh
bin/console
```

Booting installs the door, so a domain is just Ruby:

<!-- doctest:boot
Kernel.load(File.join(InMemoryDomain::ROOT, "examples/pizzas/bluebook/pizzas.bluebook"))
Hecks.hecksagon("Pizzas") do
  uses_framework "Governance"
  Pizzas::Order.persisted_by("Memory")
end
Hecks.hecksagon("Governance") do
  Governance::RoleAssignment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Governance::RoleTransition.persisted_by("Memory")
end
-->

```ruby
order = Order.create_pizza!(name: { value: "Margherita" }, pizza: { price_cents: { cents: 1200 }, size: { value: "large" } })
order.add_topping!(topping: { value: "Basil" }, amount: { value: 3 })
order.purchase!(customer_name: { value: "Chris" }, amount: { cents: 1200 })

order.status             # => "sold"
order.events.last.name   # => "PizzaPurchased"

Order.count              # => 1
Order.find(order.id).customer_name.to_h   # => { value: "Chris" }
```

That block runs on every push, claims and all — not an illustration. So
does every other `ruby`-fenced example in this README and in
`docs/implemented/guides/`; `spec/guides_spec.rb` is the harness.

A creating command is a module method and returns the new record. A
command on an existing record is a method on that record — identity is
already known — and returns `self`, so commands chain. `bin/run <domain>
<script.json>` executes a step list of commands and queries from JSON and
reports events, refusals, and rows; `bin/fuzz` generates and runs these
scripts itself, checked against declared properties.

## The domain: bluebook, hecksagon, world

A domain is three files. `.bluebook` declares what the domain *is* —
aggregates, commands, rules — independent of how any deployment runs it.
`.hecksagon` wires it to real ports: which adapter persists it, which
framework it attaches to, which ports it exposes. `.world` holds the one
thing neither of those names — per-deployment values, like a database
URL or a Lambda's memory limit. Each file below is real, trimmed to the
pieces this section shows; the untrimmed originals are
`examples/pizzas/bluebook/`.

```ruby skip
examples/pizzas/
  bluebook/
    pizzas.bluebook        the domain
    pizzas.hecksagon       the wiring
    pizzas.world           the per-deployment values
  data/
```

### bluebook

```ruby skip
aggregate "Order" do
  identified_by :name

  attribute :name,     PizzaName
  attribute :toppings, list_of(Topping)

  value_object "PizzaName" do
    attribute :value, String

    invariant("a pizza is named") { !value.to_s.empty? }
  end

  value_object "Topping" do
    attribute :name,   String
    attribute :amount, Integer
  end

  lifecycle :status, default: "available" do
    transition "Purchase" => "sold", from: "available"
  end

  command "CreatePizza" do
    role "Chef"
    goal "Put a new pizza on the menu"

    attribute :name,  PizzaName
    attribute :pizza, Pizza

    emits "PizzaCreated"
  end

  command "AddTopping" do
    role "Chef"
    goal "Customize a pizza with an ingredient"

    reference_to Order
    attribute :topping, ToppingName
    attribute :amount, ToppingAmount

    given("a sold pizza cannot be changed") { status == "available" }
    given("at most 10 toppings")            { toppings.size < 10 }

    sets :toppings, append: { name: :topping, amount: :amount }

    emits "ToppingAdded"
  end
end
```

`given` refuses before `sets` runs; a value object's own `pattern:`
refuses before its own invariant does — checked in that order, on the
same booted domain as the Quickstart above:

```ruby
Order.create_pizza!(name: { value: "" }, pizza: { price_cents: { cents: 900 }, size: { value: "small" } })   # ~> TypeMismatch: PizzaName.value must match [^ \t\n\r], got ""
```

A command's mutation either replaces a field (`sets :status, to:
"sold"`) or appends to a list (`sets :toppings, append: ...`, above).
Some domains need a number that raises rather than replaces — an
account's balance, for example:

```ruby bluebook
Hecks.bluebook "Banking" do
  vision "Customers hold accounts, accounts move money, and every movement is a transfer that can fail halfway. The domain that has to get it right twice — once in the rules, once in the recovery."
  core

  aggregate "Account" do
    identified_by :number

    attribute :number,  AccountNumber
    attribute :balance, Money

    value_object "AccountNumber" do
      attribute :value, String
      invariant("an account number is present") { !value.to_s.empty? }
    end

    value_object "Money" do
      attribute :cents,    Integer, default: 0
      attribute :currency, String,  default: "USD"

      invariant("a currency is a three-letter code") { currency.to_s.size == 3 }
    end

    value_object "PositiveMoney" do
      attribute :cents,    Integer
      attribute :currency, String, default: "USD"

      invariant("an amount is positive") { cents.positive? }
      invariant("a currency is a three-letter code") { currency.to_s.size == 3 }
    end

    lifecycle :status, default: "open" do
      transition "FreezeAccount" => "frozen", from: "open"
    end

    command "Open" do
      role "Branch clerk"
      goal "Give a customer somewhere to keep money"

      attribute :number, AccountNumber

      sets :number

      emits "AccountOpened"
    end

    command "Credit" do
      role "Teller"
      goal "Put money in"

      reference_to Account
      attribute :amount, PositiveMoney

      given("the account is open") { status == "open" }

      sets :balance, increment: :amount

      emits "AccountCredited"
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby boot
Hecks.hecksagon("Banking") do
  uses_framework "Governance"
  Banking::Account.persisted_by("Memory")
end
Hecks.hecksagon("Governance") do
  Governance::RoleAssignment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Governance::RoleTransition.persisted_by("Memory")
end
```

```ruby
account = Account.open!(number: { value: "1001" })
account.credit!(amount: { cents: 500, currency: "USD" })

account.balance.to_h                                     # => { cents: 500, currency: "USD" }
account.credit!(amount: { cents: -1, currency: "USD" })    # ~> InvariantViolation: an amount is positive
```

(A trimmed subset of `examples/banking/bluebook/` — the full `Account`
also holds a `kind`, a `daily_limit`, a `ledger` of `LedgerEntry`, and
the `Customer` it belongs to.)

Every effect a command may cause is one of a closed set of declared
verbs; every refusal is a named `given` or invariant. A required
attribute missing from a payload refuses at the gate, before any effect
resolves. Events are emitted last, after state is persisted. Refusals
are checked, not incidental: `spec/corpus/` runs a scripted exercise of
every declared refusal across the whole corpus.

### hecksagon

The only file that names a real adapter, attaches to a real framework,
or exposes a real port to the outside world:

```ruby skip
Hecks.hecksagon "Pizzas" do
  uses_framework "Governance"
  Pizzas::Order.persisted_by("PostgresEra")

  # A second front door, called from outside this domain (a payment
  # processor's webhook, in practice). No given, no sets — this is the
  # boundary translating an external fact into domain vocabulary. The
  # rule itself stays on Purchase (pizzas.bluebook), reached only
  # through a policy beside it.
  Pizzas::Order.port "PaymentGateway" do
    operation "Receive" do
      attribute :customer_name, CustomerName
      attribute :amount, Price
      emits "PizzaPaymentReceived"
    end
  end
end

Hecks.hecksagon "Governance" do
  Governance::RoleAssignment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Governance::RoleTransition.persisted_by("Memory")
end
```

That's `examples/pizzas/bluebook/pizzas.hecksagon`, in full — the same
`uses_framework`/`persisted_by` calls the Quickstart's hidden boot block
runs (with `Memory` in place of `PostgresEra`, since the Quickstart needs
no real database). A port declared here is an ordinary command reached
by an external caller; no rule lives on it that doesn't already live on
the aggregate.

### world

Values a `.hecksagon` file's adapter needs but shouldn't hard-code — a
database URL, a realm, a Lambda's memory and timeout:

```ruby skip
# examples/pizzas/bluebook/pizzas.world
Hecks.world "Pizzas" do
  realm "Examples"
  persisted_by("PostgresEra") do
    database "postgres://localhost/hecks_pizzas"
  end
end
```

```ruby skip
# examples/banking/bluebook/banking.world
Hecks.world "Banking" do
  realm "Examples"
  latest "v1"
  persisted_by("Heki") do
    dir "data"
  end

  projected_by("SqliteProjection") do
    database "data/banking_projection.sqlite3"
  end

  deployed_to("AwsLambda") do
    region "us-east-1"
    memory 512
    timeout 10
    database "Shared"   # no RDS of Banking's own
    owner "Embryonaut"  # isolated by its own native Postgres schema
  end
end
```

A `.world` block is checked against what its adapter declares — a value
the adapter doesn't know refuses at boot rather than being silently
ignored. Fields belong to the **adapter**, not the port: `PostgresEra`
needs a `database`; `Memory` needs nothing at all.

## The expression sublanguage

A command's predicate is Ruby, parsed by Prism and stored as canonical
text rather than held as a closure:

```ruby skip
given("at most 10 toppings") { toppings.size < 10 }
                     ↓
            "toppings.size < 10"
```

The Ruby is what you write; the canonical text is what the runtime reads
back, diffs, and stores — the same reason a domain as a whole is data
rather than code.

Admissible grammar:

```ruby skip
||  →  &&  →  .include?  →  >= <= < > == !=  →  leaves
```

Leaves are literals, dotted value-object paths, `.size`/`.length`,
`.positive?`/`.negative?`/`.zero?`, `.modulo(n)`, and the block-taking
enumeration operators over a list — `.any?`/`.none?`/`.all?`/`.find { |x|
… }`, the block's body a whole predicate of its own. An operator is admitted
only once it reads as a real rendering — an operator with no rendering is
not a slow operator, it is not an operator. That sentence is checked, not
aspired to: every operator the evaluator runs passes through the grammar
chapter's own Admit gate on each suite run
(`lib/hecks/grammar/expression_operators.json`, held by
`spec/operator_conformance_spec.rb`).

## Runtimes

**Persistence.** `persisted_by` in a `.hecksagon` file picks one; the
matching `.world` block configures it:

```ruby skip
Memory         in-process, nothing on disk — tests, bin/console's default
Sqlite         a local file — no server, no config beyond a path
Postgres       a real server, no era tracking
PostgresEra    Postgres plus the era system — see Eras below
Heki           an append-only journal on disk — no server, real durability
Folder         reads a domain's own declaration off disk, not a backend
Prism          Ruby's own parser, extracting predicate source (above)
```

Swapping `Memory` for `PostgresEra` — a `.hecksagon` line, plus the
`database` field the `.world` block now needs — is the entire migration.
The `.bluebook` file never names a backend, so it never changes.

**Dispatch.** Ruby is the reference implementation. `rust/` is a second
dispatch runtime, generated from the same canonical IR and checked
against Ruby continuously: `spec/codegen_parity_spec.rb` holds Rust's
generated output byte-identical to Ruby's, `spec/rust_conformance_spec.rb`
runs the same corpus scripts through the compiled binary and diffs the
result against Ruby's. `bin/project_rust` generates typed Rust structs
and enums for every value object, entity, and aggregate record; `given`/
`ensures`/mutation logic stays data, interpreted at runtime by one small
kernel (`rust/src/kernel/{expr,dispatch}.rs`) that walks it the way
`CommandInterpreter#call` does in Ruby. The parser is generated too, not
hand-written a second time.

[Running a runtime](docs/implemented/guides/running-a-runtime.md) has
what a third dispatch runtime, in a different language, needs field by
field. [`docs/implemented/rust-experiment.md`](docs/implemented/rust-experiment.md)
documents an earlier, fully hand-written Rust runtime and why it was
replaced by this architecture.

## Projections

Every deployment artifact is generated from a domain's own declaration —
none are hand-authored. `bin/project_deploy` reads a `.world` file's
`deployed_to("AwsLambda")` block and generates a SAM template, Makefile,
`samconfig.toml`, and bastion config: self-contained, owning its own VPC
and RDS Postgres instance, no secret typed anywhere (RDS's managed
master password plus a CloudFormation dynamic reference compose the
connection string at deploy time). `sam build && sam deploy` from there.

Siblings, same rule — no hand-authored artifact, only a generator run
against a declaration: `bin/project_wasm` (bluebook → `.wasm`),
`bin/project_rust` (IR → Rust), `bin/project_oidc` (→
`<domain>/oidc.json`), `bin/project_cli` (→ a named binary for one
domain). [The tools](#the-tools) has the rest.

## Diagrams

<!-- generated:begin id=diagrams -->
`bin/project_diagrams` reads a booted domain's own declaration and draws it as Mermaid — nine kinds so far: `<Name>_lifecycle.mmd`, `relationships.mmd`, `dispatch.mmd`, `roles.mmd`, `ports.mmd`, `read_models.mmd`, `<Name>_surface.mmd` (what a command does, and what it writes), `<Name>_saga.mmd`, and `frameworks.mmd`. Nothing hand-drawn — the same reason a domain is data at all. Order's own lifecycle, straight off the bluebook above:

```mermaid
%% GENERATED by bin/project_diagrams from Order's own declared lifecycle (field: status) — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.
%% Re-run `bin/project_diagrams <domain-path> Pizzas` after any change.
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> available
    available --> sold: Purchase
```

The full set for every domain in this checkout — `examples/pizzas`, `examples/banking` — lives in [`docs/generated/diagrams/`](docs/generated/diagrams/), held to the declaration by `spec/diagrams_spec.rb` the same drift-refusing way this page is held to its own source.
<!-- generated:end -->

## Eras & the Postgres adapter

A domain's shape changes; its stored history doesn't. `PostgresEra` holds
the source text a booted domain was born from, refuses on drift between
held text and booting text, and requires a deliberate change to ship
with a translation: `rename`, `convert`, `drop`, `retype`, `retired`, and
`compute` rules in a `translations/*.bluebook` file, carrying the old
era's records into the new shape. `compute` is a raw SQL expression,
evaluated inside Postgres — no second, application-side copy of the
logic to drift from.

Plain `Postgres` has no era tracking. Memory, Sqlite, and Heki have none
either — a domain there boots whatever text it's handed.

## Language versions

Every word of the bluebook surface carries its own lifecycle in
`syntax.bluebook` — proposed, admitted, deprecated, retired. A proposed
or retired word reaches no projected parser table: to a projected reader
it does not exist. A renamed word keeps its old spelling in `was:`, so a
bluebook written under an earlier spelling keeps parsing. `bin/evolve`
walks a language change through the stations: snapshot, rewrite,
regenerate, gate, restore-on-red.

## Machine-readable IR

A booted domain's IR is JSON, not prose — the same structure the golden
specs pin and the Rust generator reads:

```sh
bin/ir examples/pizzas              # a domain's full IR
bin/query_ir examples/pizzas duplicates   # structured queries against it
bin/hecks_query_ir_mcp                    # the same two queries, as an MCP server
```

`bin/hecks_query_ir_mcp` exposes `QueryIR`'s queries as MCP tools, so a
coding agent calls them directly instead of shelling out to `bin/query_ir`
and parsing stdout. `bin/model_check` runs static analysis over the IR —
unreachable lifecycle states, dead transitions, saga states nothing
reaches. `bin/shape` prints the exact storage-shape hash an era mints
from a bluebook, for reading rather than asserting against.

## The folder convention

A domain's `bluebook/` folder holds only what's its own — see
[The domain](#the-domain-bluebook-hecksagon-world) above. Ports and
adapters ship with the library instead, beside their implementation:

```ruby skip
lib/hecks/ports/            the PORT — the how-verb and the signal
lib/hecks/adapters/driven/
  sqlite.adapter                 the DECLARATION
  sqlite.rb                      the IMPLEMENTATION
  memory.* heki.* postgres.* folder.* prism.*
```

A project bringing its own port or adapter puts them in a `ports/` or
`adapters/` folder above its domains, found by walking up — the
library's own load runs first, so a project's can only add, never
replace.

## The corpus

<!-- generated:begin id=corpus -->
- **banking** — Customers hold accounts, accounts move money, and every movement is a transfer that can fail halfway. The domain that has to get it right twice — once in the rules, once in the recovery.
- **compliance** — Something elsewhere already acted to contain a risk; this domain tracks the human review that decides what happens next.
- **pizzas** — Put toppings on a pizza and sell it to a customer.
- **roster** — A crew roster: seats added one at a time, members enlisted, each seated once — the smallest domain whose every rule is a question asked of a LIST.

## The library

```ruby skip
lib/hecks/
  language/     the language, declared in its own bluebooks.  WHAT A BLUEBOOK IS.
  grammar/      the expression and translation sublanguages, and the Admit gate.
  bluebook/     dsl → ir → expression.  READING ONE.
  runtime/      dispatch, instances, the registry.  RUNNING IT.
  adapters/     driven: memory, sqlite, heki, postgres, folder, prism.
  translation/  domain-version translation — eras and lineage.
  projector/    IR serialization — the translation-edge digest reads it.

  facade/               the door.  Class-free, per boot.
  router/               project-wide dispatch; installs each chapter's namespace at boot.
  ports/                domain ports — auth, identity, persistence, query.
  query_specification/  a query's shape, held apart from any engine that answers it.
  projections/          IR as a capability — emits_ir and its consumers (OIDC, reference, parser table).
  forms/                IR → HTML, content-negotiated against plain JSON.
  fuzzing/              generated sequences, checked against declared properties.
  doc/                  the generated DSL reference (bin/reference).
  framework/            shared, domain-agnostic bluebooks — Governance, Identity, ConsoleSettings.
  deploy/               the Deploy bluebook — what deployed_to means.
```

The split follows the dependency direction, not the topic: the
expression evaluator lives in the semantic core, not `projector/`,
because the runtime evaluates every `given` and invariant through it
directly. Nothing here is required by `require "hecks"` unless a booted
domain uses it — `forms/` and `fuzzing/` stay out of the core boot
chain, so a project that never touches one never pays for it.

## Verify

```sh
bundle exec rspec                 # the whole suite
bundle exec parallel_rspec spec   # same suite, split across your machine's cores (local only)
bin/model_check                   # static analysis over the IR — unreachable states, dead transitions
bin/fuzz                          # generated sequences, checked against declared properties
```
