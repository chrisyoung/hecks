# THE LINEAGE DIFFERENTIAL HARNESS — ADR 0029's step 4/5, `rust/host`'s
# own sibling to spec/rust_conformance_spec.rb. That spec proves parity
# for the KERNEL crate (compiled dispatch/type-checking, one process,
# no Postgres); this one proves it for the one thing `rust/host` alone
# does — read and write across a REAL era boundary a REAL Ruby mint
# produced, for the generic lineage path (`journal::
# read_lineage_head_all/_by_id`/`append_lineage_mutation`) every
# lineage-capable aggregate shares, not just `Member`.
#
# `mint_and_seed_lineage.rb` (rust/host/tests/fixtures/) does the
# minting AND the writing, then hands back its own ground truth: era 1's
# raw writes run through Ruby's OWN `Ports::Persistence::Lineage#
# translate` — the same in-process reference the real Layer 2 audit
# checks Postgres's compiled SQL against — merged with era 2's own
# untranslated writes. `lineage_harness` (rust/host/src/bin/) is the
# Rust side: a real compiled binary, connecting as the RLS-fenced app
# role (not the owner — the owner bypasses RLS entirely, which would
# prove nothing about the fence a real deployment actually runs behind),
# reading and writing through nothing but the generic functions.
#
# Deliberately does NOT reuse Ruby's OWN read as the oracle (e.g.
# `PostgresEra#find`/`#all`) — that would only prove "Rust's SQL client
# agrees with Ruby's SQL client reading the SAME compiled view," a
# structurally weaker claim than "Rust agrees with Ruby's own
# independently-computed translation." See mint_and_seed_lineage.rb's
# own header for the full argument, and its compute/rekey sibling for
# the one case where the weaker claim is genuinely the best available.
#
# `io: true` — real I/O (a `cargo build`, two Postgres roles, a mint) —
# excluded locally by default (spec_helper.rb), always run in CI, same
# discipline as every other Postgres/Rust spec.
