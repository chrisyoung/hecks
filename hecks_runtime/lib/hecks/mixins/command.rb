# Hecks::Command
#
# Mixin for generated command classes. Orchestrates the full command lifecycle:
# run guard policy, run handler, execute call (with optional middleware),
# persist aggregate, emit event, and record event.
# The generated call method is pure domain logic — just build and return
# the aggregate.
#
# == Lifecycle
#
# When +.call+ is invoked the following steps execute in order:
# 1. Guard policy (+guarded_by+) -- rejects unauthorized commands
# 2. Handler callback (+handler+) -- optional pre-processing hook
# 3. Precondition checks -- domain invariants that must hold before execution
# 4. +#call+ (user-defined) -- builds/modifies the aggregate; may be wrapped by command bus middleware
# 5. Postcondition checks -- domain invariants that must hold after execution
# 6. Persist aggregate via the wired repository
# 7. Emit event via the wired event bus
# 8. Record event in the event recorder for the aggregate
#
# == Chaining
#
# Commands can be chained fluently with +#then+. If any step raises, the
# chain short-circuits and the error is captured on the originating command.
#
# == Usage
#
#   class CreatePizza
#     emits "CreatedPizza"
#
#     def call
#       Pizza.new(name: name)
#     end
#   end
#
#   cmd = CreatePizza.call(name: "Margherita")
#   cmd.aggregate  # => #<Pizza>
#   cmd.event      # => #<CreatedPizza>
