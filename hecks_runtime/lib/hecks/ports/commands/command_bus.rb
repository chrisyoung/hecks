    # Hecks::Commands::CommandBus
    #
    # Dispatches commands through a middleware pipeline. Each middleware
    # wraps the next, like Rack middleware for commands. The bus resolves
    # command and event classes from the domain module, builds a middleware
    # chain, and publishes the resulting event on the event bus.
    #
    # == Middleware
    #
    # Middleware can be registered as blocks or objects. Each receives the
    # command and a +next_handler+ proc. Call +next_handler.call+ to continue
    # the chain; skip it to short-circuit.
    #
    # == Usage
    #
    #   bus = CommandBus.new(domain: domain, event_bus: event_bus)
    #
    #   bus.use :logging do |command, next_handler|
    #     puts "Dispatching #{command.class.name}"
    #     result = next_handler.call
    #     puts "Done"
    #     result
    #   end
    #
    #   bus.dispatch("CreatePizza", name: "Margherita")
    #   # => #<PizzasDomain::Pizza::Events::CreatedPizza>
