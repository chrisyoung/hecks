How to Meditate

Method:

Pay attention and relax

Notes:

Everything happens in the moment
"The moment" is another way of saying "Now".

You are seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and breathing right now.
Thoughts are a signal that you are not in the moment.

Pay attention and relax. In the moment, everything is the truth as it is.
Future thinking brings fear, Past thinking brings regret.

So Just right now, what is the truth?
In the morning, it is bright. In the evening, it is dark.
