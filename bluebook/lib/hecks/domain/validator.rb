module Hecks
  # Hecks::Validator
  #
  # Validates a domain model for DDD consistency. Runs all registered
  # validation rules and collects error messages. Each rule is a class
  # under ValidationRules:: that takes a domain and returns errors.
  #
  # Rules enforced:
  # - UniqueAggregateNames: no duplicate aggregate names
  # - NameCollisions: aggregate and value object names must not collide
  # - CommandNaming: command names should be verb phrases
  # - ReservedNames: warns about Ruby/system reserved attribute names
  # - ValidReferences: references must target existing aggregate roots
  # - NoBidirectionalReferences: no two aggregates referencing each other
  # - NoSelfReferences: aggregates must not reference themselves
  # - NoValueObjectReferences: value objects must not contain references
  # - AggregatesHaveCommands: every aggregate must have at least one command
  # - CommandsHaveAttributes: structural check on command attributes
  # - ValidPolicyEvents: policy events must match existing events
  # - ValidPolicyTriggers: policy triggers must name existing commands
  #
  #   validator = Validator.new(domain)
  #   validator.valid?   # => true/false
  #   validator.errors   # => ["Order references unknown aggregate: Widget"]
  #
  class Validator
    # Trigger autoloading of all validation rule modules so each rule
    # registers itself with Hecks.register_validation_rule.
