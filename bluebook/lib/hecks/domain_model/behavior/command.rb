    # Hecks::DomainModel::Behavior::Command
    #
    # Intermediate representation of a domain command -- an intent to change state.

    # and actors. Can infer a corresponding event name by converting the verb
    # to past tense (CreatePizza -> CreatedPizza).
    #
    # Part of the DomainModel IR layer. Built by CommandBuilder or EventStorm
    # parser, consumed by CommandGenerator and event inference in AggregateBuilder.
